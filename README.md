# Get The Weather ðŸŒ¦

This is a weather app project in which the user can interact with the app,  
save weather locations to favorites, and see the upcoming weather for the next 5 days.  
The app UI is **responsive** for all screen sizes

##### Technology used:
- React.js
- Redux
- UI library: material UI

The `GlobalStateInitialSetters.js` is used to initialize all the global states  
with the correct data, and to manipulate the data while the events change  
using `useEffect` hooks.  
The `changeFavoriteCards` global state checks if the location exists in the state,  
if the location exists the function removes it, if the location doesn't exist  
the function adds it to the state.
